# Contributing Guide

Thanks for helping build heart-driven intelligence.

## Ground Rules
- Be kind. Follow our Code of Conduct.
- Small PRs. One logical change per PR.
- Include tests or runnable examples.
- Keep public data synthetic.

## Development
- Python: use virtual envs (`uv`, `pipx`, or `venv`).
- Node: `pnpm` preferred but npm/yarn OK.
- Lint: `ruff` (py), `eslint` + `prettier` (js/ts).

## Commit Style
Conventional commits, e.g. `feat(sdk-py): add hrv rmssd`

## Releasing
Weâ€™ll tag releases `vX.Y.Z` with changelogs.
